	<h3>Soft skills for a software engineer</h3>

	<ul><li> Patience </li></ul>
	<p>
	  Software development is not an easy feat. It is a complex effort which often includes long processes. From the project kick-off, through the project execution, testing, deployment, updates… Most of these activities take a lot of time, even in agile environments. Patience is especially important when you are starting as a developer. The most important person you’ll ever have to be patient with is you. Give yourself enough time, enough chances to make errors, and fix them. Once you are patient with yourself, it’s easier to be patient with other people. Sometimes people will need more convincing, you will need to do your best to “sell” them your idea or approach. Being patient is your ally in this mission.

	<ul><li> Open-mindedness and adaptability</ul></li>

<p> Steve Jobs famously said during his Stanford commencement address –

	   <blockquote> “Stay hungry. Stay foolish.”</blockquote>

	   <p> In essence, he encourages you to be open-minded. He is trying to make you be receptive to other people’s feedback. His words are relevant today as new technologies and paradigms emerge.</p>

	   <p> A decade or so ago – waterfall software development model was still ruling. Later came the more agile and lean approaches. This means that people had to change their mindsets and adapt to the change. Some were more successful in those efforts. Others struggled. While our inclination to be open-minded and adaptable might have its roots in our upbringing and general worldview, it can be developed far more outside those initial settings.</p>
