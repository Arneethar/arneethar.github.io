	<h3>Soft skills for a software engineer</h3>

	
	<p>As a software engineer it is not enough to have the technical skills, you should be able to possess certain skills that would help you thrive as a successful software engineer and a great team member. I will be listing the most important soft skills to me and these are Communication, Empathy, Patience, Open-mindedness and adaptability.</p>
	<p>

	  <ul><li> Communication</li></ul>

	  Communication is a usual suspect in most soft skills lists – not only for developers – but for any profession. But in software development, communication is crucial. Keep in mind that communication is a two-way road. You need to be a good listener. Listening to your colleagues, customers, or users will make all the difference. When you listen, you are getting an unfair advantage compared to those who only talk. You get to learn things, expand your horizons, and broaden your worldview. It also helps you rank tasks and requirements.</p>


	<ul><li> Empathy</li></ul>
	
	While you might spend a lot of your time writing code for machines, you are interacting with other people. “Putting your self in other person’s shoes” is a way to describe empathy in straightforward terms. Understanding other people, their belief systems, their mental and personal characteristics will benefit you. You will be able to adjust your behavior, to address their needs, and make sure that you are taking them into account. This is something that is often overlooked. But, the best developers will try and understand their customers or colleagues since it will enable them to do their job . Again, empathy is your advantage – it will allow you to see things with their eyes. It will make you more sensible and approachable.
